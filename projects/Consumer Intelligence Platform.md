# Consumer Intelligence Platform

An end-to-end consumer analytics platform combining advanced ML segmentation, predictive modeling, LLM-powered persona generation, and an interactive stakeholder dashboard.

---

# Elevator Pitch

The Consumer Intelligence Platform is a comprehensive analytics system designed for product managers, marketing teams, and data scientists who need to understand customer behavior at scale. It transforms raw consumer data into actionable insights through automated segmentation, predictive modeling, and AI-generated persona profiles. The platform solves the critical problem of making complex customer analytics accessible without requiring specialized data science expertise for every query.

What makes this solution interesting is its end-to-end approach: from synthetic data generation to ML model training to interactive visualization, all running locally with optional LLM integration. The platform differentiates itself by combining traditional machine learning (clustering, gradient boosting, random forests) with modern LLM capabilities for persona generation, while maintaining a focus on model explainability and fairness auditing—capabilities often missing in commercial analytics tools.

# Product Overview

**Users**: Product managers, marketing analysts, data scientists, and business stakeholders who need customer insights without depending on data science teams for every analysis.

**Primary Workflow**: Users generate or upload consumer data, train ML models through a guided pipeline, then explore results through an interactive dashboard. The workflow is: generate data → train models → explore segments → review personas → analyze predictions → audit fairness → simulate scenarios.

**Core Functionality**: The platform generates synthetic consumer datasets (100k+ records), performs feature engineering (RFM scores, engagement metrics), runs clustering segmentation, trains three predictive models (churn, LTV, conversion), generates AI-powered persona profiles, provides SHAP-based explainability, conducts fairness audits, and offers a what-if simulation tool.

**Inputs**: Consumer demographic data (age, gender, income, location), behavioral metrics (purchase history, session data, engagement scores), and transactional data (spend, frequency, recency). The platform can also generate realistic synthetic data for testing.

**Outputs**: Segment assignments with visualizations, persona profiles with motivations and pain points, churn/LTV/conversion predictions, feature importance explanations, fairness audit reports, and interactive what-if scenario results.

**User Experience**: A dark-mode dashboard with sidebar navigation, real-time training progress, interactive visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, bar charts), and responsive design. The pipeline interface guides users through data generation and model training with live logs.

**Real-World Use Case**: A marketing team uses the platform to segment their 100k customer base, identify high-value loyalists versus at-risk customers, understand churn drivers through SHAP explanations, and simulate the impact of retention campaigns before execution—all without writing code or waiting for data science backlog.

# Problem Statement

Organizations struggle to transform customer data into actionable insights because traditional analytics require specialized data science skills, expensive commercial tools, or lengthy development cycles. Product managers and marketers need to understand customer segments, predict churn, estimate lifetime value, and personalize interventions—but they often lack direct access to ML models or interpretability tools.

Existing solutions are insufficient because: (1) Commercial analytics platforms are expensive and often black-box, limiting customization; (2) Building custom ML solutions requires data science expertise and significant development time; (3) Most tools focus on either segmentation OR prediction OR explainability—not an integrated pipeline; (4) Fairness and bias auditing are rarely included in standard analytics workflows; (5) LLM integration for persona generation is uncommon in traditional ML tools.

This project addresses these gaps by providing a complete, locally-hosted platform that integrates data generation, segmentation, prediction, explainability, fairness auditing, and LLM-powered personas in a single accessible interface.

# Key Features

## Data Generation & Feature Engineering

Generates realistic synthetic consumer datasets at scale (10k–500k records) with demographics, behavioral metrics, transactional history, NPS scores, and time-series activity. Computes advanced features including RFM scores (recency, frequency, monetary), engagement index, digital activity score, support burden, and session quality metrics. This feature enables testing and experimentation without requiring access to sensitive real customer data.

## ML Segmentation Engine

Performs unsupervised clustering using KMeans or Gaussian Mixture Models with automatic PCA dimensionality reduction for 2D visualization. Assigns descriptive segment labels (e.g., "High-Value Loyalists", "At-Risk Customers") based on cluster statistics and computes silhouette scores for quality assessment. This enables users to discover natural customer groupings without manual labeling.

## Predictive Modeling Suite

Trains three supervised learning models: Gradient Boosting for churn prediction, Random Forest for lifetime value regression, and Logistic Regression for conversion scoring. Each model includes cross-validation, performance metrics (accuracy, AUC, R²), and feature importance rankings. This provides actionable predictions for retention, revenue forecasting, and marketing optimization.

## LLM-Powered Persona Generation

Uses local Ollama LLM (llama3) to generate rich, human-readable persona profiles for each segment including names, taglines, motivations, pain points, recommended actions, and narrative descriptions. Includes intelligent fallback to curated templates when LLM is unavailable. This transforms statistical segments into relatable customer profiles that stakeholders can act on.

## Model Explainability

Computes SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for tree-based and linear models to provide per-prediction feature attribution. Falls back to permutation importance when SHAP is unavailable. Displays global feature importance rankings and sample-level explanations showing which features drove specific predictions. This builds trust in ML outputs and enables actionable insights.

## Fairness & Bias Auditing

Automatically audits model predictions for demographic disparities across gender, income bracket, and geographic tier using standard fairness metrics including adverse impact ratio (80% rule) and demographic parity. Flags problematic disparities and generates specific mitigation recommendations. This addresses ethical AI concerns and helps ensure equitable treatment across customer groups.

## What-If Simulation

Provides an interactive tool where users can adjust feature values (e.g., increase email open rate, reduce support tickets) and see real-time predictions from all three models. This enables scenario planning and "what-if" analysis to understand the potential impact of interventions before implementation.

## Interactive Dashboard

Premium dark-mode interface with sidebar navigation, real-time training progress with live logs, interactive visualizations using Recharts (scatter plots, histograms, bar charts), and responsive design. The pipeline interface guides users through the end-to-end workflow with status indicators and error handling.

# AI / ML Components

**LLM Integration**: Uses Ollama (llama3 model) running locally for two purposes: (1) generating synthetic customer review text during data generation, and (2) creating rich persona profiles from cluster statistics. Implements structured prompting with JSON response requirements, regex-based parsing, and intelligent fallback to curated templates when LLM is unavailable.

**Clustering**: Implements both KMeans and Gaussian Mixture Model for unsupervised segmentation. Uses PCA for 2D dimensionality reduction and visualization. Computes silhouette scores for cluster quality assessment. Assigns descriptive labels based on cluster characteristics.

**Supervised Learning**: Gradient Boosting Classifier for binary churn prediction with 200 estimators and depth 4. Random Forest Regressor for lifetime value prediction with 150 trees and depth 8. Logistic Regression with balanced class weights for conversion prediction. All models use train/test splitting with appropriate metrics (accuracy, AUC, R²).

**Feature Engineering**: Computes RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores using log transformations and normalization. Derives engagement score from email metrics, session data, and app usage. Calculates digital activity score as log-transformed session quality. Creates support burden metric and spend-per-day ratios.

**Explainability**: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability. TreeExplainer for gradient boosting and random forest models. LinearExplainer for logistic regression. Provides both global feature importance and per-prediction attribution with waterfall-style explanations.

**Fairness Auditing**: Implements demographic parity difference and adverse impact ratio (80% EEOC rule) across protected attributes. Generates specific mitigation recommendations based on detected disparities. Audits both churn and conversion predictions for bias.

**Prompt Engineering**: Structured system prompts for persona generation requiring specific JSON schema (name, tagline, motivations, pain_points, recommended_actions, narrative). Implements few-shot-style prompting with cluster statistics as context.

# Product Thinking

**User-Centric Design**: The platform is designed for non-technical stakeholders by abstracting ML complexity behind a simple interface. The pipeline guides users step-by-step through data generation and model training with live progress logs and clear status indicators.

**Reducing Friction**: Eliminates the need for data science teams by providing pre-built models that work out of the box. Synthetic data generation enables immediate experimentation without data access barriers. Optional LLM integration degrades gracefully when unavailable.

**Workflow Optimization**: Integrates what would typically be separate tools (segmentation, prediction, explainability, fairness) into a single cohesive workflow. Users can move from discovering segments to understanding drivers to planning interventions without switching contexts.

**Decision Support**: Persona profiles translate statistical segments into actionable customer archetypes with specific motivations and pain points. Recommended actions provide concrete next steps for each segment. What-if simulation enables scenario planning before resource commitment.

**Accessibility**: Dark-mode design with high contrast for reduced eye strain. Responsive layout works across different screen sizes. Clear visual hierarchy with KPI cards, charts, and narrative text to accommodate different learning styles.

**Personalization**: LLM-generated personas create relatable customer profiles that feel specific rather than generic. Segment labels are descriptive and actionable (e.g., "At-Risk Customers" rather than "Cluster 1").

**Scalability**: Architecture supports datasets from 10k to 500k records. Background threading keeps the API responsive during training. Sampling strategies ensure visualization performance at scale.

**Adoption Strategy**: Optional Ollama integration means the platform works immediately without additional setup. Fallback templates ensure core functionality is never blocked by missing dependencies. Clear troubleshooting documentation addresses common issues.
